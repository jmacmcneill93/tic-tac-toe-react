# Tic-tac-toe made with Reach framework

This is an app I made during the Road to Hire program where I used React hooks to build a tic tac toc application.

## Cloning the website
Download or clone this repoistory onto your computer. Once that is complete, you will need to install the node packages that were used to build this application. Yoiu can download the packages by running `npm i` in your terminal. 

## Running the app
After you have installed the packages you need, you can now run this project on your command line. Once you are in the root directory of the project, you can then run `npm start` in your command line. The React app will then open in a new tab, running the application on the local host of your computer. 

## Stopping the app
To stop the server from running, you hit `command + c` or `command + z` to stop both the server and the react app.
